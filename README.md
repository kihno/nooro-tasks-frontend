This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To run this example, first ensure the connected [Server](https://github.com/kihno/nooro-tasks-backend) is up and running.

Then, initialize the frontend:
